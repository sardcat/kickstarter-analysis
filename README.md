# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Up-and-coming playwright Louise, following the near-success in funding her earlier play FEVER via Kickstarter, approached "the team" for further data analysis. Curious into how similar campaigns fared in relation to launch dates and funding goals, "the team" analysed Kickstarter data in Excel to provide Louise with a written report and visualization to help her launch her next project.

### Purpose

To utilize Kickstarter data imported into Excel for data filtering, charting and graph generation to meet client's (Louise) request. Written report to follow.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
